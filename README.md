## Setup and Execution

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the repository** into your local machine or download the `.tar` file and extract it into your working directory.  
2. **Windows users**: Install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to run a virtual Linux environment and create an account.  
3. In WSL, **navigate** to the directory where you placed the project files.  
4. The source code will be linked with the object code we supply into a driver binary. To create this binary, execute the following commands:

   ```bash
   unix> make driver

   To test your implementations, run:
```bash
unix> ./driver
